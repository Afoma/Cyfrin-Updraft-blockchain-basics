### Sybil resistance
Sybil resistance is a blockchain's ability to defend against users creating a large number of pseudo-anonymous identities 
to gain a disproportionately advantageous influence over a said system. It is basically a way for blockchains to defend against
somebody making a bunch of fake blockchains so they can get mnonre and more rewards.

There are 2 types of Sybil resistance:
Proof of work and proof of stake

Proof of work is sybil resistance because it has to go through a mining, a computationallyy expensive process, 
to figure out the answer to the blockchain's riddle of finding the correct nonce or whatever system the blockchain has in place. 
Proof of work works because no matter how many pseudo-anonynmous accounts you make, they still have to go through the 
copmutationally expensive process of finding the answer to the blockchain's riddle or problem. Some blockchains make it 
intentionally hard or easy to change the block time. Block time is how long it takes between blocks being 
published and it is proportional to how hard these algorithms are. If the system wants the block time to be very long, they make
the problem or riddle to be very hard.

With proof of work, in order to find out who the block author is, you have to combine it with a chain selection rule. Bitcoin 
and ethereum use the Nakamoto consensus which is a combination of proof of work and longest chain rule.
